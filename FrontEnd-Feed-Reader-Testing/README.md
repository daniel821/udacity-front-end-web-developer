# Project Overview
----

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Tests
----

- Ensure each `allFeeds` object has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
- Ensure each `allFeeds` object has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
- Ensure the menu element is hidden by default.
- Ensure the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
- Ensure when the `loadFeed` function is called, there is at least one entry.
- Ensure when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function the content actually changes.

## How to Run
----

Clone the repository and open `index.html` with your browser.
